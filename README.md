## edits
Our goal was to expand on the monster subclass, and create a variety of different monsters, just as we did when expanding Warrior.java
In order to do this, we created three monsters, and added special attacks to each and have them similar attributes to the warriors, and restructured the driver file to include a random chance at getting any of the three monsters each time a new monster was encountered
Niko added the Skeleton.java file, Shaikat added the goblin.java file, and Marcus added Troll.java
