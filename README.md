# YoRPG_NMS
Nikolas Cruz-Marsted, Marcus Ng, Shaikat Islam

##Edits
Our goal was to expand on the monster subclass, and create a variety of different monsters, just as we did when expanding **Warrior.java**.
In order to do this, we created three monsters, and added special attacks to each and gave them similar attributes to the warriors, and also restructured the driver file to include a random chance at getting any of the three monsters each time a new monster was encountered.
Niko added the **Skeleton.java** file, Shaikat added the **Goblin.java** file, and Marcus added **Troll.java**. We also made use of the variable *movecount* and introduced a *stats* functionality at the end of the file.

##Instructions
